Klax loads and plays without any obvious issues: Playable. Rampage loads and plays without any obvious issues: Playable, multi-tap not tested. Smash TV is occasionally stuck in a firing direction until X, O, Square or Triangle is pressed and some short duration green enemy jitter occasionally occurs at the very start of the first screen: Playable, dual analog also supported. Super Sprint gets stuck on a flickering blue screen when loading: Unplayable. Toobin' has minor flickering during load transition screens but game screens show no obvious issues: Playable.)
