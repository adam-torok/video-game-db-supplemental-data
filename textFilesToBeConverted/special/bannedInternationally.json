Unlike other banned video games, the NMC had extended their focus for this title going far as to issue the TRA to block the game's official website120 and subsequently prevent the title from being distributed throughout the rest of the GCC, as well as Jordan, and Lebanon.121 Even local retailers, such as Geekay Games, are unable to sell the game via their online shops to UAE residents.122 The game remains unavailable via digital platforms such as Steam and PSN."

      "banned in UAE: Was initially banned likely due to sexual themes, nudity, excessive depictions of violence, and use of drugs and alcohol. The game's local distributor had confirmed that the title will be available in the U.A.E. and the rest of the region by August 15, 2014 for some platforms (PS3, PS4, Xbox 360) and without any in-game alterations.124 Only copies of the game with localised Middle East covers were allowed, subsequently banning imported copies for other platforms. For example, the Xbox One version was not released until some time after the console itself was officially launched in September 2014. The PC version remains unavailable, consequently blocking access to the downloadable version on Steam. Due to the fact Ubisoft cannot officially distribute their games on Nintendo consoles specifically for the Middle East (for various reasons), the Wii U version remains unavailable (Ubisoft games on Nintendo consoles are generally available as imported products in the region)."

The publishers made edits at the request of the BBFC to further mask these scenes,129 and this final version received an 18 certificate."
